REACT-ROUTER
it does not come with REACT
>npm install --save react-router-dom

we gonna need 4things from react-ROUTER
1)Browser router : it gonna hold the info of all the routes
2)Switch: for grouping routes
3)Route :display specific route
4)Link: serve as anchor tag


alias:
different name for that thing
use  'as'
import {BrowserRouter as Router} from 'react-router-dom';


go to index.js and place <App/> component within the BrowserRouter
so that our app has access to all the routes that we are creating

in app.js:
import {Switch,Route} from 'react-router-dom



Route:
<Switch>

  <Route  component={Default}></Route> //for any wrong route
  <Route  path="/" component={ServiceList}></Route> //write this is bottom

  //or use exact path <Route exact path="/" component={ServiceList}></Route>

</Switch>




WORKING WITH NAVBAR: navbar.js
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';
