</React.Fragment>
its does not need to assign div again and again

install ES7 REACT/REDUX/GRAPHQL/REACT-NATIVE SNIPPETS:
so as to use the shorthands like rcc

install Bracket Pair Colorizer

 3 more component we gonna create
1)details
2)cart
3)default when the page is not found


eg:
import React,{Component} from 'react';

class Cart extends Component{
render(){
    return(
        <div>
            Hello from Cart
        </div>
    )
}
}
export default Cart;





REACT-ROUTER
it does not come with REACT
>npm install --save react-router-dom

we gonna need 4things from react-ROUTER
1)Browser router : it gonna hold the info of all the routes
2)Switch: for grouping routes
3)Route :display specific route
4)Link: serve as anchor tag


alias:
different name for that thing
use  'as'
import {BrowserRouter as Router} from 'react-router-dom';


go to index.js and place <App/> component within the BrowserRouter
so that our app has access to all the routes that we are creating

in app.js:
import {Switch,Route} from 'react-router-dom



Route:
<Switch>

  <Route  component={Default}></Route> //for any wrong route
  <Route  path="/" component={ServiceList}></Route> //write this is bottom

  //or use exact path <Route exact path="/" component={ServiceList}></Route>

</Switch>




WORKING WITH NAVBAR: navbar.js
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';


<nav className="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-dark px-small-5"></nav> //woring with bootstrap navbar
1)navbar-expand-sm - work for small screens
2)navbar-dark - so that while hovering the link doesnot apper white
3)px-small-5 - adding padding of 5 when in small screen



--ADDING LINKS TO IMAGES
import logo from '../logo.jpg';

inside NAVBAR component:

  <Link to='/details'>
                <img src={logo} alt="services" className="navbar-brand" height="80px"></img>
  </Link>

//when we click on that images it will take us to /details page

//adding button for my Cart
<Link to='/cart' className="ml-auto">
                   <button>
                       <i className='fas fa-cart-plus' /> My Cart
                   </button>
</Link>
